J.P Morgan Java Technical Test 
------------------------------

Expectations 
--------------

Treat this exercise as if it was a task you were implementing as part of a normal working day.  In your submission you are expected to include everything you would commit to source control before signing off the task as production ready. 
	- No database or UI is required 
	- You can assume the code will only ever be executed in a single threaded 	  	 		environment.
	- Minimise the number of external jar dependencies your code has.  We would expect 		a maximum of 1 or two would be required. 
	- All data to be in memory.
	- Output format to be plain text, printed out to the console. 
	- Create more sample data as needed. We would expect you to spend somewhere in the 		region of about 3 hours on this exercise. 

The problem
------------

Implement a small message processing application that satisfies the below requirements for

processing sales notification messages. You should assume that an external company will be sending

you the input messages, but for the purposes of this exercise you are free to define the interfaces.


Processing requirements
-----------------------

* All sales must be recorded

* All messages must be processed

* After every 10th message received your application should log a report detailing the number of sales of each product 
  and their total value.

* After 50 messages your application should log that it is pausing, stop accepting new messages and log a report of the
  adjustments that have been made to each sale type while the application was running.

Sales and Messages
------------------
* A sale has a product type field and a value â€“ you should choose sensible types for these.

* Any number of different product types can be expected. There is no fixed set.

* A message notifying you of a sale could be one of the following types

* Message Type 1 - contains the details of 1 sale E.g apple at 10p

* Message Type 2 - contains the details of a sale and the number of occurrences of that sale. E.g 20 sales of apples at 10p each.

* Message Type 3 - contains the details of a sale and an adjustment operation to be applied to all stored sales of this product type. 
  Operations can be add, subtract, or multiply e.g Add 20p apples would instruct your application to add 20p to each sale 
  of apples you have recorded.

							Execution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Requirements
 ------------
Java 1.8
  
 How to use?
 ------------

	Use any IDE.
	Download SalesNotificationMessageProject from github and import into IDE as existing projcts in workspace through general type.
	Run SalesNotificationMessageMainClass as Java Applicaiton.

 
Solution
--------
 
 The solution implements a SalesNotificationMessageMainClass class that uses custom data structures defined for SalesMessageDetails,MessageReadAndParserDetails,
 ProductDetails, and PriceAdjustmentDetails, and SalesMessageLog which 
 solves the above defined problem.
 
 Input File:
 salesmessagedetails.txt - It contains sales message details. 


Assumptions
----------- 
 
* The sale items are always fruits.
* There may be invalid messages but only null and empty string and String length are considered.
* The incoming messages have fixed format based on the message type e.g.; 
      - Message Type 1 contains 3 words.
      - Message Type 2 contains 6 words.
      - Message Type 3 contains 3 words but always begin with an operational instruction such as Add, Subtract, and Multiply.
* Execution to continue processing messages until 50 sales details are logged that includes the instruction message type 3 as well.
* Logging omitted instead System.out.println used since there was no request on explicit exception handling on incoming messages other than
   neglecting it and recording only parsed messages.
